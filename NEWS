  Berlios project.  Check version in makefile as well as Makefile.

0.9: 2005-04-03
  The Channels variable is gone. There are no longer default public channels;
  you put the ones you want in your Destinations variable.  For safety's sake
  the force (-f) option is also gone; generated deliverables are now built 
  unconditionally, and you must explicitly make sure no index.html exists 
  in order to get one generated.  There is now a "berlios" channel.

  addressing. 

0.5: 2004-02-06
  Added security check so the ~/.shipper and .shipper files can't be used
  for privilege elevation.  Fixed upload omission bug in case where neither 
  -n nor -f was on and the webpage wasn't being built.  Deliverables 
  created for upload are deleted at end of run.

0.4: 2004-01-11
  Correct extraction of freshmeat name.  Build generated deliverables
  only if we know they will be needed. Help is now available at the 
  freshmeat-focus prompt.

  rpm2lsm now grabs an RPM from the current directory if no argument,
  and parses an AUTHORS file if present (GNU convention).  Also,
  this release fixes a bug in USERNAME handling.

0.1: 2002-08-01
  Initial release of rpm2lsm, since folded into shipper package.
