  Berlios project.  Check version in makefile as well as Makefile.

* Thu Mar  3 2005 Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> - 0.9
  The Channels variable is gone. There are no longer default public channels;
  you put the ones you want in your Destinations variable.  For safety's sake
  the force (-f) option is also gone; generated deliverables are now built 
  unconditionally, and you must explicitly make sure no index.html exists 
  in order to get one generated.  There is now a "berlios" channel.

* Sat Aug 21 2004 Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> 0.6
  Fixed a minor bug in the generation of lftp commands.  Also, generate
  a To line into email announcement.  Mailman doesn't like implicit
  addressing. 

* Fri Feb 6 2004 Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> 0.5
  Added security check so the ~/.shipper and .shipper files can't be used
  for privilege elevation.  Fixed upload omission bug in case where neither 
  -n nor -f was on and the webpage wasn't being built.  Deliverables 
  created for upload are deleted at end of run.

* Sun Jan 11 2004 Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> 0.4
  Correct extraction of freshmeat name.  Build generated deliverables
  only if we know they will be needed. Help is now available at the 
  freshmeat-focus prompt.

* Sat Jan 10 2004 Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> 0.3
  First alpha release of unified shipper package.  It can ship itself.

* Wed Dec 17 2003 Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>
  rpm2lsm now grabs an RPM from the current directory if no argument,
  and parses an AUTHORS file if present (GNU convention).  Also,
  this release fixes a bug in USERNAME handling.

* Thu Aug  1 2002 Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>
  Initial release of rpm2lsm, since folded into shipper package.
