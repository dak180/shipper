<refsect1><title>Description</title>

<para><application>shipper</application> is a tool for shipping
project releases.  Its job is to make it possible for you to run the
command <command>shipper</command> in the top-level directory of a
project and have a release be properly exported to all the places that
you normally deliver it &mdash; your personal website, Linux source
code archive sites, and distribution submission queues. A second goal
is to arrange your shipping process in such a way that metadata like
your project version only have to be kept in one place and modified
once per release. The overall goal is to reduce the friction cost
of shipping releases to as near zero as possible.</para>

<para>As much as possible, <application>shipper</application> tries to
deduce what it should do rather than requiring you to tell it.  In
order to do this, it relies on your project obeying standard GNU-like
naming conventions.  It also relies on being able to mine project
metadata out of a package specfile. A package specfile may be either 
an RPM spec or a Debian control file; for both, <command>shipper</command>
expects to see a small handful of extension fields that tell ut
what to do.</para>

<para>In normal use, you need set only one header,
<quote>Destinations:</quote> which is the list of destinations to ship
to.  You may also want to add some magic <quote>Project-Tag-List</quote>
headers to your project specfiles.  Once you have
<application>shipper</application> up and running, you can experiment
with more advanced features such as having the program generate
project web pages for you.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>Theory of Operation</title>

<para><application>shipper</application> pushes
<emphasis>deliverables</emphasis> out to
<emphasis>destinations</emphasis>.  Deliverables include: source
tarballs, source zip archives, ChangeLog files, README files,and
various other project metadata files.  Destinations include both
<emphasis>private destinations</emphasis> like websites, FTP archive
sites and mailing lists, and <emphasis>public destinations</emphasis>
like freshmeat.net and berlios.de. The
<application>shipper</application> framework is extensible and it is
relatively easy to add new destination types and new deliverables; in
the future, we hope to support SourceForge and other forge sites as
destinations.</para>

<para>The <application>shipper</application> program's first step is
to read the <filename>.shipper</filename> files in your home directory
and the current directory.  These set various control variables and
templates <application>shipper</application> will use later.</para>

<para>Second, <application>shipper</application> reads per-project
information from a specfile, either an RPM spec or a Debian control
file. The project name, version, and various other pieces of
project-related metadata are extracted from the specfile.</para>

<para>The <option>-n</option> (nobuild) option causes
<application>shipper</application> to dump all configuration values
and exit immediately after collecting them.</para>

<para>The first real work that gets done is finding deliverables.
These are either unversioned project metadata (like a README or NEWS
file) or versioned product files such as source tarballs. Finding
deliverables is separated from uploading because it means that you can
stop and inspect what you're going to ship before committing to an
upload.</para>

<para>The last step before uploading may be to generate an 
<filename>index.html</filename> file for uploading, if
no such file alreay exists.</para>

<para>Without the -u (upload) option,
<application>shipper</application> stops just before uploading,
displaying the exact upload commands that would have been used to ship
deliverables.  Thus, the command <command>shipper</command> with no
options will show you exactly what <application>shipper</application>
would do for a real upload.</para>

<para>Otherwise, <application>shipper</application> then uploads
deliverables and posts all announcements.  The <option>-x</option> may
be use to suppress delivery to specified destinations that would
normally be performed (e.g., due to a destination variable set in one
of your <filename>.shipper</filename> files>); it may be a
comma-separated list.</para>

<para>After deliverables have shipped successfully and notifications
posted, <application>shipper</application> determines if the directory
it is in is a working copy in a version-control system that supports
release tagging.  If so, and the <option>-t</option> has been
selected, it tries to tag the release just shipped.  See <xref
linkend='postinstall'/> for discussion of what version-control systems
are supported and what actions will be taken.</para>

<para>Finally, note that <application>shipper</application> makes one
important assumption about the structure of your website(s).  Beneath
each directory in your <varname>destinations</varname> list, there
will be one subdirectory for each project, with the directory leaf
name being the same as the project.  Thus, for example, if you have
three projects named ruby, diamond and sapphire, and your personal
site is at <filename>gemstones.net:/public/www/precious/</filename>,
<application>shipper</application> will expect to be able to drop
deliverables in three directories
<filename>gemstones.net:/public/www/precious/ruby</filename>,
<filename>gemstones.net:/public/www/precious/diamond/</filename>, and
<filename>gemstones.net:/public/www/precious/sapphire/</filename>.
Note that <application>shipper</application> will not create these
project directories for you if they're missing; this is deliberate, so
that uploads to sites that are not prepared for them will fail
noisily.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>How Shipper Deduces What To Do</title>

<para>The behavior of shipper depends on a handful of internal
variables.  Some of these variables have defaults computed at startup
time.  All can be set or overridden in the per-user
<filename>~/.shipper</filename> file, and overridden again in any
per-project <filename>.shipper</filename> file.  Both files are Python
code and the syntax of variable settings is Python's.</para>

<para>If a variable is set in a config file, that value is locked in
(except for the <varname>destinations</varname> variable which can be
appended to from a specfile, see below) Variables that are
<emphasis>not</emphasis> set in a config file may be set by the values
of fields in your project specfile.</para>

<para>For basic use, it is only necessary to set one such variable:
<varname>destinations</varname>, the list of destinations to ship to.
Normally you'll set this globally, pointing all your projects at your
main distribution website and public drop sites, in your
<filename>~/.shipper</filename> file.  It is also possible to add
destinations on a per-project basis by giving a comma-separated list
in a #Destinations: comment in the specfile.  You can set the variable
in a per-project <filename>.shipper</filename> to ignore your global
destination list.</para>

<para>The first thing shipper looks for is a specfile in the current
directory; there must be exactly one.  It extracts the project name
from the Name field.  Next step is to find the project version (the
variable <varname>package</varname>).  This is extracted from the
Version field of the specfile, or by looking for a makefile macro with
a name beginning with VERS; if the value of that macro is a shell
command wrapped in $(shell ...), it is executed and the output is
captured to yield the version.  If both versions are present, they are
consistency-checked.</para>

<para><application>shipper</application> gets most of the rest of the
data it uses to decide what to do from headers in the specfile.
The following table lists all the variables and their corresponding
specfile fields.</para>

<refsect1 id='postinstall'><title>After Deliverables have Shipped</title>

<para>Currently, the only version-control systems supported for tagging
after shipping are Subversion and git.</para>

<para>When uploads are complete, <application>shipper</application>
looks at where it is running.  If it is in the trunk of a Subversion
repository (that is, the current directory is name
<filename>trunk</filename> and has a subdirectory named
<filename>.svn</filename>) and there is a <filename>tags</filename>
peer directory, and the tags directory does not have a subdirectory
named "$version", then <application>shipper</application> copies and
tags the contents of trunk.  If it is in a git repository (that is,
there is a subdirectory named <filename>.git</filename>) it will git
tag the release.</para>

<para>You can change this action by setting the variable
<varname>tag_template</varname>. If you set it to None,
release tagging will be suppressed entirely.  If you set it to a
nonempty string, that will become the template for the name of the
tag directory.  "%s" in the string will be replaced with the
version number.</para>

<para>You can also customize the actual log message by setting the variable
<varname>tag_message</varname>.  See the default with <command>shipper
-N</command>; the %s in it will be replaced with the version.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1><title>Command-line Options</title>

<para>The -n option of <application>shipper</application> suppresses
uploads, just building all deliverables locally (and not deleting

<para>The -m option tells <application>shipper</application> to
generate a web page an upload it to website destinations.</para>

<para>The -t option tells <application>shipper</application> to
attempt to tag the local repo after shipping.</para>

<para>The -v option makes <application>shipper</application> chatty
about what it's doing.  The -h option prints a usage message and
exits.</para>
